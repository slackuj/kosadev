I've been working as a Qt software development on a regular basis for some time. 
Due to my passion for Qt technology and the eternal hunger to realise next projects. I've started the **Scythe Studio company - the software house specialized in Qt framework**.

Now we are nearly 20 people and I do not code that much due to other responsibilities. However, I have more time now to work on open source projects and to create conent for
the community.

Scythe Studio is an official Qt Service Partner and a provider of Qt Software Development services including:
- Desktop applications development
- Mobile applications development
- Embedded systems development
- Qt and C++ consulting
- UI/UX designing

I am the main programmer and maintainer of [SCodes - Qt & Qml wrapper for ZXing library](https://github.com/scytheStudio/SCodes).
This library allows you to easily scan and generate 1D and 2D barcodes in your Qt and Qml applications.

## Contributions to the Qt framework :construction_worker:
I believe that community input is crucial for future of the Qt framework. Therefore I contribute to the Qt repository.
